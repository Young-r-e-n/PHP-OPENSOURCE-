The differences between PDO (PHP Data Objects) and MySQLi (MySQL Improved) primarily revolve around their features, database support, and the way they handle prepared statements and transactions. Here's a detailed comparison based on the provided sources:

Database Support
PDO: The main advantage of PDO is its support for 12 different database types, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more. This makes PDO a versatile choice if you're working with multiple database systems or planning to switch databases in the future.
MySQLi: MySQLi is specifically designed for MySQL databases. While it supports MySQL only, it offers a procedural API, which can be easier for newcomers to understand if they are familiar with the original PHP MySQL extension.
Prepared Statements and Named Parameters
PDO: PDO supports named parameters in prepared statements, which can make your code more readable and easier to maintain. This feature is particularly useful when you have complex queries with multiple parameters.
MySQLi: MySQLi uses a numbered parameter system for prepared statements, which can be less intuitive than named parameters. However, it does offer the ability to auto-detect variable types, which can be beneficial in certain scenarios.
Error Handling
PDO: PDO throws exceptions when an error occurs, which can be caught and handled using a try-catch block. This approach is considered more modern and flexible for error handling.
MySQLi: MySQLi does not throw exceptions by default. Instead, it uses error codes and error information, which you can retrieve using mysqli_error() and mysqli_errno(). This method requires manual error checking.
Performance
PDO: While there's no definitive performance benchmark that shows PDO is faster than MySQLi, the choice between the two often comes down to the specific requirements of your project rather than performance alone.
MySQLi: MySQLi might offer slightly better performance in some cases due to its direct integration with MySQL. However, the performance difference is generally minimal and should not be the primary factor in choosing between PDO and MySQLi.
Security
PDO: PDO supports prepared statements, which can help prevent SQL injection attacks by separating SQL logic from the data being passed to it. This feature is crucial for writing secure database applications.
MySQLi: MySQLi also supports prepared statements, making it a secure option for database operations. However, the way you use prepared statements can affect the security of your application.
Conclusion
The choice between PDO and MySQLi depends on your specific needs, such as the databases you're working with, your preference for named parameters in prepared statements, and how you handle errors. PDO offers more flexibility and database support, making it a good choice for projects that might need to work with multiple database systems. MySQLi, on the other hand, might be more suitable for projects that exclusively use MySQL and prefer a procedural style of coding.
